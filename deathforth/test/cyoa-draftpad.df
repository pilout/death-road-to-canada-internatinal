(* Open up cyoa-example-7types and use it as a handy guide. Also open charfilt and charstats.

Make 6 to 10 CYOA events. Then rename them to a different file, and make a new draftpad to make a new set of events. Repeat until done.

We can have many different df files for event cards. Use a naming convention like:
	cyoa- first letter of first name- short description of cyoas in file - number if there's a lot of files about the same thing
		cyoa-j-bandits.df
		cyoa-d-florida1.df
		cyoa-k-paranoid.df

The examples in 7types should cover most of the CYOA types in the game, except for some oddballs we decide to make. I may add more types to that file later, as templates.
