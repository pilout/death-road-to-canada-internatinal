		"You can keep your car going way longer if you have a great mechanic in the team." shove
		"If you don't like your Always Be Looting choices, try driving around for new locations." shove
		"More people means more fighters! It also means more food consumption." shove
		"Someone with maxed Medical skill needs less medical supplies for healing, or sometimes none." shove
		"Higher Shooting skill means better firearms handling, with each shot piercing more zombies!" shove
		"Strength lets you pick up and throw heavier furniture. Thrown furniture is the best weapon." shove
		"A combination of Strength and Fitness determines weapon swing speed and energy use." shove
		"Make sure you create some custom characters! They can show up at random in the game." shove
		"For the final stage of the trip, you will need a good group or great weapons." shove
		"Fitness determines how much melee energy you have, and how quickly you recover it." shove
		"TIRED gives big stat penalties! Clear it by sleeping in the next camp or resting before a mission." shove
		"If team member morale gets too low, they will start arguing, despairing, and backstabbing." shove

		"Bandit characters can rob many traders and other people. This can backfire depending on who is robbed." shove
		"Slow, heavy weapons can be powerful with high Strength and Fitness. Otherwise they can be awful." shove
		"Some melee weapons break and some don't! Many common breakable weapons compensate by being light." shove
		"Zombies have to grab onto you for a short time before they can damage you. Run away to break free!" shove
		"Losing your car opens you up to nearly constant negative events and bandit attacks." shove
		"Many traders offer you different things depending on how much food you have." shove
		"If you have little or no food, some traders will pity you and give free stuff!" shove
		"Dogs are very fast. For fun, try having a dog solo loot a city as everyone rests!" shove
		"Dog barking, horns, gunshots, and other noises draw zombie attention." shove
		"Zombies can chase you for a long time, depending on how aggressive and irritated they get." shove
		"Some places are death traps! Read the zombie forecast before exploring an area." shove
		"Fire and explosives can damage your own characters, so watch out. Fire is especially dangerous." shove
		"Fire can clear out an army of zombies if you're lucky. It's very dangerous to use indoors." shove
		"Punching a zombie with no weapon barely does anything, besides making one let you go for a moment." shove
		"You can switch what character you are controlling in the pause menu, for finer control." shove
		"Characters that are close by can throw weapons to each other in the pause menu." shove
		"Try sacrificing someone you don't like by getting them eaten on purpose. This will distract zombies." shove
		"Character stats are initially hidden. Characters you recruit may be lying about their abilities!" shove
		"Many bandits can be bought off with food. Some bandits can be beaten by a specific personality type." shove

		"Closing doors will hold off zombies for awhile, as they all forgot how to open doors." shove
		"Zombies attack furniture that gets in the way. You can drop or throw objects to make obstacles." shove
		"Some cars types are easier to repair than others, requiring a smaller Mechanical skill." shove
		"A very high Mechanical skill will let you repair a car right away. Further repairs become harder." shove
		"Slow-shooting firearms are very ammo efficient. Sometimes you'll want to spray ammo with an automatic." shove
		"Some melee weapons cleave, hitting multiple zombies in one swing. Some cleaves are based on chance." shove
		"Zombies get more aggressive and numerous at night. Zombies smell you better if you're bleeding." shove
		"Zombies get hit for extra damage if they are knocked down, first. Some weapons have high knockdown." shove
		"Some great melee weapons for high stat people: Knight's Sword. Sturdy Machete. Fire Axe. Sledgehammer." shove
		"Some great melee weapons for low Strength/Fitness: Aluminum Bat. Nightstick. Xtreme Hockey Stick." shove
		"Shotguns are still very effective for people with low Shooting skill. High damage and knockdown." shove
		"The pistols and the Uzi have the advantage of bullets being the most common ammo type." shove
		"Automatic weapons are very hard to control if you have low Shooting skill." shove
		"Rifles have high damage and high piercing. One shot could splat an entire line of zombies." shove
		"You can often have teammates rest in the car. Useful if someone's hurt or you want a smaller group." shove
		"There's no real penalty for getting a teammate eaten by zombies. Just throwing that fact out there." shove
